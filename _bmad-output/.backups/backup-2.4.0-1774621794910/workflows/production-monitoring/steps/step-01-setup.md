# Step 1: Setup & Multi-Experiment Input Validation

Production monitoring operates at portfolio scale — multiple graduated experiments running in production simultaneously. Before we can monitor anything, we need the experiment contexts that established the baselines. Production data is the most honest user feedback — it can't lie — but monitoring multiple experiments without their baselines is watching dashboards without understanding what you're looking at.

## Why This Matters

A single production signal viewed in isolation is just a number. Multiple production signals viewed without experiment context is just a bigger dashboard. The signal indicates something very different for each experiment depending on what was tested, what was confirmed, and what behavior was expected. Portfolio monitoring requires all the experiment contexts loaded and validated so that every signal can be measured against the right baseline.

## Your Task

### 1. How Many Experiments Are You Monitoring?

Production monitoring works with **multiple experiments simultaneously**. Provide the experiment contexts for all active experiments you want to monitor:

| # | Experiment | Input |
|---|-----------|-------|
| 1 | *name or description* | HC4 file path or description |
| 2 | *name or description* | HC4 file path or description |
| 3 | *(if applicable)* | |

Noah expects experiment context — ideally produced by Wade's experimentation workflow as HC4-compliant artifacts:
- **HC4 Experiment Context** (from Wade's `lean-experiment` workflow)
- **HC4 Experiment Context** (from Wade's `proof-of-concept`, `proof-of-value`, or `mvp` workflows)

You can also bring **any well-formed experiment summaries** — Noah accepts input from outside the Vortex pattern. It doesn't have to be HC4-compliant, but having structured experiment results with explicit success criteria makes portfolio monitoring dramatically more precise.

### 2. Provide Your Inputs

Please provide file paths or describe each experiment context. For example:
- `_bmad-output/vortex-artifacts/hc4-experiment-alpha-2026-02-20.md`
- `_bmad-output/vortex-artifacts/hc4-experiment-beta-2026-02-22.md`
- Or: "I have three experiments running — onboarding flow, pricing page, and search redesign"

### 3. Per-Experiment Input Validation

I'll check each artifact against the HC4 schema to assess readiness:

**HC4 Frontmatter Check (per experiment):**
- `contract: HC4`
- `type: artifact`
- `source_agent` (who produced it)
- `source_workflow` (which workflow)
- `target_agents: [noah]`
- `input_artifacts` (upstream references)
- `created` (date)

**HC4 Body Section Check (per experiment):**
- Experiment Summary (Name, Description, Type, Duration, Graduation Status)
- Hypothesis Tested (Statement, Riskiest Assumption, Expected Outcome, Target Behavior Change)
- Experiment Method (Method Type, Sample Size, Planned Duration)
- Pre-Defined Success Criteria (Metric, Target Threshold, Actual Result, Met?)
- Additional Results (optional — Quantitative Metrics, Qualitative Results)
- Confirmed/Rejected Hypotheses (Status, Assumption Status, Core Learning)
- Strategic Context (Vortex Stream, Assumption Tested, Decision It Informs, Implications)
- Production Readiness (Metrics to Monitor, Expected Production Behavior, Signal Thresholds)

**Portfolio Validation Summary:**

| # | Experiment | HC4 Compliant | Missing Fields | Readiness |
|---|-----------|---------------|----------------|-----------|
| 1 | *name* | Yes / Partial / No | *list* | Ready / Needs Attention |
| 2 | *name* | Yes / Partial / No | *list* | Ready / Needs Attention |

**If any input is non-conforming:** That's fine — we don't reject experiment context. I'll guide you to identify which elements are present and which gaps we need to work around for each experiment. The more complete the experiment contexts, the sharper the portfolio monitoring. But even partial context is better than none — here's what we're seeing in context with whatever you can provide.

## Your Turn

Please provide your experiment contexts — file paths, descriptions, or both. I'll validate each input and we'll proceed to assembling the portfolio.

## Next Step

When all experiment contexts are provided and validated, I'll load:
