## 1. Current Coverage Map

Convoke currently covers five major lifecycle phases through its module ecosystem. Below is a consolidated view of what exists, organized by lifecycle position.

### 1.1 Discovery & Validation — Vortex (7 agents, 22 workflows)

The Vortex team implements Jurgen Appelo's Innovation Vortex pattern as a continuous, non-linear discovery engine. Emma handles problem framing and strategic context (Contextualize), Isla drives user research and empathy mapping (Empathize), Mila synthesizes research into JTBD-framed problem definitions (Synthesize), Liam engineers testable hypotheses and assumption maps (Hypothesize), Wade designs and runs lean experiments including MVPs, PoCs, and PoVs (Externalize), Noah interprets production signals and behavioral patterns (Sensitize), and Max captures validated learning and drives pivot/patch/persevere decisions (Systematize). The compass routing system creates a non-linear flow between streams based on evidence.

**Theoretical foundations:** Innovation Vortex (Appelo, 2022), Lean Startup (Ries, 2011), Jobs-to-be-Done (Christensen et al., 2016), Empathy Mapping (Gray et al., 2010), Build-Measure-Learn, Signal Detection Theory.

### 1.2 Design & Planning — WDS + BMM Phases 1–3

WDS provides a 10-step design workflow from project alignment through UX specifications, asset generation, and design system creation (agents: Freya for UX, Saga for analysis). BMM's first three phases handle requirements analysis and PRD creation (Phase 1), UX and product planning (Phase 2), and architecture and epic/story breakdown (Phase 3).

**Theoretical foundations:** Design Thinking (Brown, 2009), Human-Centered Design (d.school), Architecture Decision Records (Nygard, 2011).

### 1.3 Implementation & Quality — BMM Phase 4 + TEA

BMM Phase 4 covers development, code review, sprint planning, retrospectives, and course correction through Dev, QA, and Scrum Master agents. TEA adds a dedicated Test Architect (Murat) with 8 workflows spanning test strategy, ATDD automation, traceability, CI/CD pipeline design, and non-functional requirements assessment.

**Theoretical foundations:** Agile/Scrum practices, ATDD (Acceptance Test-Driven Development), Continuous Integration.

### 1.4 Production Readiness — Gyre (4 agents, 7 workflows)

Gyre assesses deployment readiness through a sequential pipeline: Scout detects the technology stack, Atlas generates a capabilities manifest against industry standards, Lens identifies gaps and absence patterns, and Coach facilitates review with a feedback loop back to Atlas.

**Theoretical foundations:** DORA metrics (Forsgren et al., 2018), Google PRR (Beyer et al., 2016), OpenTelemetry, SLSA, Continuous Delivery (Humble & Farley, 2010).

### 1.5 Creative, Build & Extension — CIS + BMB + Enhance + Team Factory

CIS provides creative and innovation agents (brainstorming, design thinking, storytelling, presentations). BMB enables custom agent, module, and workflow creation. Enhance adds RICE-scored backlog management to the PM agent. Team Factory guides the creation of new BMAD-compliant teams.

## 4. Knowledge Engineering: From Documentation to Knowledge Assets

> The documentation perimeter (Section 3.6) handles systematic documentation — capturing what is *explicitly written*.
> This section addresses a fundamentally different problem: **actively extracting, refining, and exposing knowledge** that is tacit, dispersed, or buried in codebases, documentation, and team expertise. This is especially critical in brownfield contexts where knowledge is the most valuable and the least accessible asset.

### 4.1 The Knowledge Problem in Product/Software Organizations

Knowledge in organizations exists on a spectrum from fully explicit (API docs, ADRs) to deeply tacit (why a particular architectural decision was made, what edge cases a senior engineer knows intuitively, what the team learned from a failed experiment three years ago). The challenge is not documentation — it's **knowledge operationalization**: making organizational knowledge extractable, refinable, and consumable as assets by discovery teams, building teams, and agents alike.

This is the theoretical foundation for a **knowledge engineering perimeter** — complementary to the documentation perimeter, focused on active knowledge extraction and operationalization.

### 4.2 Theoretical Foundations

**Tacit and explicit knowledge:**

- **The Tacit Dimension** — Polanyi, M. (1966). *The Tacit Dimension*. University of Chicago Press. "We can know more than we can tell." Establishes that much organizational knowledge cannot be articulated through documentation alone — it requires elicitation.

- **SECI Model** — Nonaka, I. & Takeuchi, H. (1995). *The Knowledge-Creating Company*. Oxford University Press. Four modes of knowledge conversion: Socialization (tacit→tacit), Externalization (tacit→explicit), Combination (explicit→explicit), Internalization (explicit→tacit). **A knowledge engineering perimeter would operationalize the Externalization phase at scale** — converting tacit team knowledge into explicit, consumable assets.

- **Knowledge Elicitation** — Cooke, N. J. (1994). "Varieties of Knowledge Elicitation Techniques." *International Journal of Human-Computer Studies*, 41(6), 801–849. Taxonomy of techniques for extracting expert knowledge: interviews, protocol analysis, card sorting, repertory grids. Foundation for structured agent-guided knowledge extraction.

- **Knowledge Engineering Principles** — Studer, R., Benjamins, V. R. & Fensel, D. (1998). "Knowledge Engineering: Principles and Methods." *Data & Knowledge Engineering*, 25(1-2), 161–197. Formal methodology for building knowledge-based systems. The knowledge acquisition bottleneck and approaches to overcoming it.

**Knowledge in software engineering:**

- **Architecture as Design Decisions** — Jansen, A. & Bosch, J. (2005). "Software Architecture as a Set of Architectural Design Decisions." *Working IEEE/IFIP Conference on Software Architecture*. Architecture knowledge is not the diagrams — it's the *decisions* and their rationale. In brownfield projects, these decisions are often undocumented and live only in team memory.

- **Mining Software Repositories** — Kagdi, H., Collard, M. L. & Maletic, J. I. (2007). "A Survey and Taxonomy of Approaches for Mining Software Repositories in the Context of Software Evolution." *Journal of Software Maintenance and Evolution*, 19(2). Systematic extraction of knowledge from version control, bug trackers, and code artifacts. The codebase *is* a knowledge repository.

- **Developer Cognition** — Ko, A. J. et al. (2006). "An Exploratory Study of How Developers Seek, Relate, and Collect Relevant Information during Software Maintenance Tasks." *IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering*. How developers actually navigate and understand codebases — informing how agents should extract and present knowledge.

- **Cognitive Debt** — Storey, M. (2026). "How Generative and Agentic AI Shift Concern from Technical Debt to Cognitive Debt." Identifies an emerging organizational risk: as AI generates more code, human understanding of the codebase erodes. Knowledge extraction becomes not just useful but *essential* to maintain organizational capability.

**Knowledge assets as a product:**

- **Knowledge Assets** — Boisot, M. H. (1998). *Knowledge Assets: Securing Competitive Advantage in the Information Economy*. Oxford University Press. The I-Space model (Information-Space): knowledge moves through phases of codification and abstraction before diffusion. Provides the theoretical frame for treating knowledge as a managed, valuable asset.

- **Working Knowledge** — Davenport, T. H. & Prusak, L. (1998). *Working Knowledge: How Organizations Manage What They Know*. Harvard Business School Press. Knowledge market metaphors: knowledge has buyers, sellers, brokers, and a price. Applicable to how a knowledge engineering perimeter would expose knowledge assets for consumption by other perimeters.

**AI-augmented knowledge extraction (2024–2026):**

- **GraphRAG** — Microsoft Research. (2024–ongoing). *GraphRAG: Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation*. https://microsoft.github.io/graphrag/. Hierarchical knowledge graph construction from unstructured text, enabling multi-hop reasoning over organizational knowledge. Goes beyond flat RAG by capturing relationships between concepts.

- **LLM-based Code Understanding** — Emerging discipline (2024–2026) using large language models for automated codebase summarization, architecture recovery, and documentation generation from code. Relevant papers from ACL, EMNLP, and ICSE conferences.

- **Semantic Code Search** — Vector-based code search enabling natural language queries against codebases. Tools like Sourcegraph Cody, GitHub Copilot Workspace, and Cursor demonstrate the pattern.

### 4.3 Knowledge Engineering Perimeter (Proposed)

**Purpose:** Actively extract, refine, and expose organizational knowledge as consumable assets — from codebases, existing documentation, and team expertise.

**Distinction from the documentation perimeter:** Documentation *captures what is produced*. Knowledge engineering *extracts what already exists but isn't accessible*.

```

```

**Potential agents:**

- **A knowledge mining capability** — Extracting knowledge from codebases (architecture recovery, dependency mapping, implicit patterns), existing documentation (contradiction detection, staleness analysis), and repository history (decision archaeology, evolution patterns). Draws on Mining Software Repositories (Kagdi et al.) and GraphRAG.

- **A knowledge elicitation capability** — Structuring guided conversations with team members to externalize tacit knowledge: architectural rationale, edge case expertise, tribal knowledge, unwritten rules. Draws on Cooke's elicitation techniques and Nonaka's Externalization phase.

- **A knowledge curation capability** — Refining raw extracted knowledge into structured, versioned knowledge assets. Maintaining a knowledge graph with provenance. Detecting knowledge decay and contradiction. Exposing assets through a consumable interface for other Convoke perimeters. Draws on Boisot's I-Space and Davenport & Prusak's knowledge market.

**Brownfield specificity:** In brownfield projects, knowledge engineering is arguably the *first* perimeter that should activate — before discovery, before readiness assessment, before anything. The existing system's knowledge is the primary input to every other lifecycle activity.

## 5. Domain Mesh: A Reference Pattern for Specialized Disciplines

> **Scope clarification:** This section describes an **architectural reference pattern** — not a commitment to build mesh infrastructure within Convoke itself. The pattern is relevant to the *projects and organizations* that Convoke supports: when teams use Convoke to build products that involve data science, ML, agentic AI, or platform engineering, this pattern describes how those specialized disciplines could be organized. It also informs how future Convoke perimeters for these disciplines might be structured, but the pattern itself lives at the product/organization level, not at the Convoke tooling level.

### 5.1 The Problem: Monolithic vs. Decentralized Specialization

Products and organizations that span multiple technical disciplines face a recurring tension. On one hand, lifecycle activities need domain-specific expertise (discovery needs data analysis, readiness assessment needs ML model evaluation, delivery needs ML deployment patterns). On the other hand, centralizing all data science or ML expertise in one team or one tool creates a bottleneck and violates the principle of domain ownership.

This tension mirrors exactly the problem that Data Mesh, Service Mesh, and now Agentic Mesh patterns were designed to solve in their respective domains. The insight is: **specialized disciplines should be organized as decentralized, self-serve, federated capabilities** — not as centralized teams or monolithic modules.

### 5.2 Mesh Pattern Foundations

**Data Mesh:**

- **Data Mesh** — Dehghani, Z. (2022). *Data Mesh: Delivering Data-Driven Value at Scale*. O'Reilly. ISBN: 9781492092391. Four principles: domain-oriented data ownership, data as a product, self-serve data infrastructure, federated computational governance. **The foundational analogy for Convoke's domain mesh: treat specialized capabilities as products owned by domains, not centralized services.**

- **Domain Ownership** — In Data Mesh, the team that produces data owns its quality and discoverability. Applied to Convoke: the team that produces ML models owns the ML assessment capability, the team that produces data pipelines owns the data quality capability.

**Service Mesh:**

- **Service Mesh Pattern** — Istio Project / Linkerd. (2017–ongoing). Sidecar proxy pattern for service-to-service communication: observability, traffic management, security, without modifying application code. The architectural insight: **infrastructure concerns (how modules communicate) are separated from business concerns (what modules do).**

- **Event Mesh** — Solace. (2017–ongoing). Event-driven architecture patterns. Extends mesh thinking to asynchronous, event-based communication. Relevant to how Convoke modules could share signals asynchronously rather than through synchronous handoff contracts only.

**Agentic Mesh (emerging):**

- **Agentic Mesh** — Broda, B. (2025). "Agentic Mesh: The Future of Generative AI-Enabled Autonomous Agent Ecosystems." *Medium / Data Science*. https://medium.com/data-science/agentic-mesh-the-future-of-generative-ai-enabled-autonomous-agent-ecosystems-d6a11381c979. Proposes mesh topology for AI agent ecosystems: decentralized agent discovery, capability advertisement, dynamic routing, and federated governance. **The most directly relevant pattern for Convoke's expansion.**

**Hexagonal Architecture & Domain-Driven Design:**

- **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)** — Cockburn, A. (2005, updated 2024). *Hexagonal Architecture Explained*. The application core is isolated from external concerns through ports (interfaces) and adapters (implementations). **Applied to Convoke: each domain module exposes capabilities through standard ports, and adapters handle the specifics of connecting to other modules or external systems.**

- **Clean Architecture** — Martin, R. C. (2017). *Clean Architecture: A Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design*. Prentice Hall. Dependency rule: dependencies always point inward toward higher-level policies. Informs how domain modules depend on the core platform, not on each other.

- **Domain-Driven Design** — Evans, E. (2003). *Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software*. Addison-Wesley. Bounded Contexts and Context Mapping. **Each specialized discipline is a Bounded Context with explicit interfaces to other contexts.** Vernon, V. (2013). *Implementing Domain-Driven Design*. Addison-Wesley. Practical patterns for bounded context integration.

**Composable & Federated Architectures:**

- **Composable Architecture** — Gartner. (2024). "Composable Business and Technology." Modular, interchangeable components assembled to meet specific needs. Each component is independently deployable, manageable, and replaceable.

- **Federated Governance** — From Data Mesh: governance is not centralized but federated across domain owners, with shared standards and interoperability contracts. Applied to Convoke: each domain module governs its own quality standards while adhering to shared handoff contract formats.

- **Cell-Based Architecture** — WSO2. (2024). Self-contained, independently deployable units of business functionality. Each cell encapsulates compute, data, and governance. Relevant to how domain modules could be self-contained yet composable.

### 5.3 The Domain Mesh Pattern (Reference Architecture)

Drawing from these foundations, here is the reference pattern for how specialized disciplines could interconnect — applicable to the products and organizations Convoke supports, and a potential inspiration for future Convoke perimeters:

**Four principles (inspired by Data Mesh):**

1. **Domain-oriented ownership** — Each specialized discipline (DataOps, MLOps, AgentOps, etc.) is owned by a domain module with its own agents, workflows, and quality standards. No centralized "data team" or "ML team" module.

2. **Capability as a product** — Each domain module exposes its capabilities through standardized ports (assess, build, monitor, advise). Lifecycle modules consume these capabilities without needing to understand domain internals.

3. **Self-serve mesh infrastructure** — A shared infrastructure layer provides discovery (which domain modules exist), routing (how to reach them), capability registry (what they offer), and governance contracts (how they interoperate). This is analogous to the service mesh's sidecar proxy layer.

4. **Federated governance** — Each domain module governs its own quality, but all adhere to shared standards: handoff contract format, capability port interface, quality metrics, and compliance baselines.

### 5.4 Proposed Domain Modules

**A DataOps domain:**

Specialized in data pipeline design, data quality, and data-as-a-product patterns.

- Dehghani, Z. (2022). *Data Mesh*. O'Reilly. Domain-oriented data ownership.
- Huyen, C. (2022). *Designing Machine Learning Systems*. O'Reilly. ISBN: 9781098107963. Data engineering foundations for ML systems.

**Ports:** Data quality assessment, pipeline design, data catalog curation, data lineage tracking.

**An MLOps domain:**

Specialized in ML model lifecycle: training, evaluation, deployment, monitoring, and governance.

- Google Cloud. (2021–ongoing). *MLOps: Continuous delivery and automation pipelines in machine learning*. https://cloud.google.com/architecture/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning. MLOps maturity model (Levels 0–2).

- Sculley, D. et al. (2015). "Hidden Technical Debt in Machine Learning Systems." *NeurIPS 2015*. The foundational paper on ML-specific technical debt.

**Ports:** Model assessment, training pipeline design, model monitoring, bias/fairness audit.

**An AgentOps domain:**

Specialized in AI agent lifecycle: design, testing, deployment, observability, and governance of agentic systems.

- Anthropic. (2024). "Model Context Protocol (MCP)." https://modelcontextprotocol.io/. Standard for agent-to-tool connectivity.
- Google. (2024). "Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A)." Standard for inter-agent communication.

- McKinsey / IBM. (2025). AgentOps emerging practices for operating AI agent systems in production.

**Ports:** Agent assessment, agent testing, agent monitoring, agent governance.

**A PlatformOps domain:**

Specialized in internal developer platform, infrastructure-as-code, and developer experience.

- Skelton, M. & Pais, M. (2019). *Team Topologies*. IT Revolution Press. Platform teams as enablers.
- Gartner. (2024). "Composable Business and Technology." Modular, interchangeable infrastructure components.

**Ports:** Infrastructure assessment, platform capability exposure, developer experience audit.

### 5.5 The Hexagonal Interface Contract

Inspired by Cockburn's Ports & Adapters, each domain module exposes a standard set of **ports** — abstract capability interfaces that lifecycle modules can consume. The concrete implementation behind each port is domain-specific, but the interface is uniform:

```
  PORT INTERFACE (standard across all domain modules):

  assess(context)   → Assessment artifact (gaps, risks, maturity level)
  build(spec)       → Implementation artifact (pipeline, model, agent, infra)
  monitor(target)   → Monitoring configuration + dashboard
  advise(question)  → Domain-specific guidance with references
```

This means Gyre can call `MLOps.assess(codebase)` to get an ML readiness assessment, or Vortex can call `DataOps.advise("what data do we have on user behavior?")` to get data-informed discovery input — without either lifecycle module needing to understand ML or DataOps internals.

### 5.6 Relationship to Convoke

The Domain Mesh pattern is not something Convoke needs to *build* — it's something Convoke should *understand and support*. When Convoke's lifecycle perimeters (discovery, readiness, delivery, etc.) encounter projects that span multiple technical disciplines, this pattern informs how those disciplines relate. It also suggests that if Convoke eventually adds perimeters for data engineering, ML, or agentic engineering, those perimeters should be designed as composable, port-based capabilities rather than monolithic modules — enabling extensibility without tight coupling.

## 6. Organizational Transformation Dimension

### 6.1 Classical Change Management

Introducing new agentic capabilities across an organization follows patterns well-documented in change management literature.

**Macro-level change leadership:**

- **Kotter's 8-Step Model** — Kotter, J. (1996, updated 2014). *Leading Change* / *Accelerate*. Harvard Business School Press. Eight-step model: create urgency → build guiding coalition → form vision → enlist volunteers → enable action → generate short-term wins → sustain acceleration → institute change. Provides the sequence for rolling out Convoke modules organization-wide.

- **Lewin's Change Model** — Lewin, K. (1947). Unfreeze → Change → Refreeze. The classic three-stage model helps frame each new Convoke module adoption as requiring: unfreezing current practices, transitioning to agent-augmented workflows, and stabilizing new behaviors.

**Individual-level adoption:**

- **ADKAR Model** — Hiatt, J. (2000s–ongoing). Prosci. Awareness → Desire → Knowledge → Ability → Reinforcement. Individual-centered model emphasizing that organizational change only succeeds when individuals change. Practical for designing adoption programs per team.

- **Bridges' Transition Model** — Bridges, W. & Bridges, S. (1991). *Managing Transitions*. Hachette. Distinguishes external change from internal psychological transition: Ending → Neutral Zone → New Beginning. Addresses the emotional journey of team members whose roles evolve alongside agent capabilities.

**Organizational alignment:**

- **McKinsey 7-S Framework** — Peters, T. & Waterman, R. (1982). *In Search of Excellence*. Harper & Row. Seven interconnected elements: Structure, Strategy, Systems, Skills, Staff, Style, Shared Values. Ensures that adding new Convoke modules is accompanied by changes in all dimensions — not just technology.

### 6.2 Organizational Design for an Agentic Era

The introduction of AI agents fundamentally challenges existing organizational structures.

**Team topology:**

- **Team Topologies** — Skelton, M. & Pais, M. (2019, 2nd ed. 2024). *Team Topologies: Organizing Business and Technology Teams for Fast Flow*. IT Revolution Press. Four team types (Stream-aligned, Enabling, Complicated-subsystem, Platform) and three interaction modes (Collaboration, X-as-a-Service, Facilitating). As Convoke modules multiply, human teams need to be reorganized around value streams where agents participate — not around functions that agents partially absorb.

- **unFIX Model** — Appelo, J. (2021–ongoing). *The unFIX Model*. https://unfix.com/. Pattern library for organizational design emphasizing versatility over fixed frameworks. Appelo's 2023–2024 work specifically addresses organizational design in the age of AI, advocating for continuous organizational iteration alongside agent capability evolution.

- **Conway's Law & Inverse Conway Maneuver** — Conway, M. (1967); LeRoy, J. & Simons, M. (2010). System architecture mirrors organizational structure. The inverse maneuver deliberately restructures teams to produce desired architectures. As Convoke adds modules, team boundaries should be designed to *enable* autonomous agent ecosystems.

- **Sociotechnical Systems Theory** — Trist, E. & Bamforth, K. (1951). Tavistock Institute. Organizations as open systems with interdependent social and technical subsystems. The principle of *joint optimization* — best match between social and technical — is critical when agents (technical) must integrate with human teams (social).

**Dynamic adaptation:**

- **Dynamic Capabilities** — Teece, D., Pisano, G. & Shuen, A. (1997). "Dynamic Capabilities and Strategic Management." *Strategic Management Journal*. A firm's ability to adapt, integrate, and reconfigure resources for changing environments. Provides the strategic frame for how organizations develop capacity to continuously evolve their agent deployment.

### 6.3 Agentic Transformation: What Makes This Different

The transformation driven by AI agents is qualitatively different from previous technology adoptions. Recent research (2024–2026) identifies specific patterns.

**Role transformation:**

- **Cyborgs, Centaurs, and Self-Automators** — Randazzo, S., Lifshitz-Assaf, H., Kellogg, K., Dell'Acqua, F., Mollick, E. et al. (2024). Harvard Business School / SSRN. Three human-AI collaboration models: Centaurs (clear task division between human and AI), Cyborgs (fluid, integrated task blending), Self-Automators (delegation with minimal engagement). Each model produces different learning and career outcomes. Centaurs upskill domain expertise; Cyborgs develop AI-native skills. Organizations need to consciously design which model they encourage.

- **Anthropic Case Study** — Anthropic. (2025–2026). "How AI Is Transforming Work at Anthropic." Engineers self-describe as "managers of AI agents" spending 70%+ time on code review/revision rather than net-new code. Live organizational case study of role transformation in an agentic organization.

- **Generative AI at Work** — Brynjolfsson, E. & Li, D. (2023–2024). NBER Working Paper. Empirical study: 15% average productivity gain, with less experienced workers benefiting most (both speed and quality). Heterogeneous effects by skill level demand differentiated organizational responses.

**Organizational redesign for agents:**

- **The Agentic Organization** — McKinsey & Company. (2025–2026). "The Agentic Organization: Contours of the Next Paradigm for the AI Era." Framework for how organizations fundamentally restructure: flatter structures, higher context sharing, rapid decision-making, with AI agents as organizational participants rather than just tools.

- **Google Cloud AI Agent Trends 2026** — Google Cloud. (2026). Five shifts: Task-to-Role-Based AI, Multi-Agent Orchestration, Governance and Real-Time Controls, Team Empowerment (Managers of Agents), Measurable Results Focus. 1,445% surge in multi-agent system inquiries Q1–Q2 2025.

- **Co-Intelligence** — Mollick, E. (2024). *Co-Intelligence: Living and Working with AI*. Penguin Random House. Three structural pillars: AI in leadership, AI labs, democratize AI to the crowd. Practical framework for organizational leaders.

### 6.4 Governance Frameworks

As Convoke expands across the lifecycle, governance becomes essential — both for the agent system itself and for the decisions agents participate in.

**Decision governance:**

- **Cynefin Framework** — Snowden, D. (1999–ongoing). "A Leader's Framework for Decision Making." *Harvard Business Review* (2007). Five domains: Clear, Complicated, Complex, Chaotic, Disorder. Helps determine which decisions agents can handle autonomously (Clear/Complicated) versus which require human judgment (Complex/Chaotic).

- **DACI Framework** — Atlassian (2010s). Driver, Approver, Contributors, Informed. When agents participate in decisions, DACI needs extension to clarify agent roles: can an agent be a Driver? A Contributor? How is accountability maintained?

**Technology & AI governance:**

- **TOGAF** — The Open Group. *TOGAF Standard, Version 9.2*. Architecture Development Method with governance processes. 80% Fortune 500 adoption. Provides structured governance for technology decisions including AI agent architecture.

- **IEEE 7000 Series** — IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems. (2019–present). Five core principles: Human Rights, Well-being, Accountability, Transparency, Minimizing Misuse. Framework for responsible AI governance.

- **EU AI Act** — European Union. (2024). *Regulation (EU) 2024/1689*. Risk-based framework with compliance requirements for AI systems. As Convoke agents participate in product decisions, they may themselves fall under regulatory scope.

- **ISO/IEC 42001** — ISO/IEC. (2023). First international standard for AI management systems. Enables formal governance, audit, and certification of AI practices.

### 6.5 Adoption & Diffusion

Rolling out new Convoke modules across an organization follows adoption dynamics documented in diffusion research.

- **Diffusion of Innovations** — Rogers, E. (1962, 5th ed. 2003). *Diffusion of Innovations*. Free Press. Innovators → Early Adopters → Early Majority → Late Majority → Laggards. Five factors: relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, observability. Each new Convoke module needs a diffusion strategy.

- **Crossing the Chasm** — Moore, G. (1991, 3rd ed. 2014). *Crossing the Chasm*. HarperCollins. The gap between early adopters (visionaries) and early majority (pragmatists) requires different messaging and whole-product strategies. Relevant to moving Convoke from pilot teams to organization-wide adoption.

- **Behavioral Design** — Fogg, B. J. (2019). *Tiny Habits*. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Prompt. Designing micro-behaviors that make agent adoption frictionless. Eyal, N. (2014). *Hooked*. Penguin. Trigger → Action → Variable Reward → Investment. Designing internal tools that teams naturally adopt.

- **Nudge Theory** — Thaler, R. & Sunstein, C. (2008). *Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness*. Yale University Press. Choice architecture that alters behavior predictably without restricting options. Making agent-augmented workflows the default path of least resistance.

- **Psychological Safety** — Edmondson, A. (1999–ongoing). Harvard Business School. Shared belief that a team is safe for interpersonal risk-taking. Foundational for teams experimenting with AI agents, reporting issues, and learning from failures. Across all literature reviewed, psychological safety emerges as the strongest predictor of successful AI adoption.

### 7.2 The Three-Axis Architecture

This expansion introduces a conceptual shift from a linear pipeline to a **three-axis architecture**:

The **Lifecycle axis** (horizontal) describes *when* things happen — from strategy through sunset. Modules here are sequential or cyclical, connected by handoff contracts.

The **Domain Mesh axis** (vertical) is a *reference pattern* describing *what expertise* is needed — data, ML, agents, platform. This pattern applies to the projects and organizations Convoke supports, and would inform the design of any future domain-specialized Convoke perimeters.

The **Cross-cutting axis** spans the entire platform. Knowledge engineering feeds understanding into every perimeter. Security ensures compliance across all phases. Documentation captures knowledge everywhere. Governance and change management governs the transformation itself.

### 7.3 The Governance & Change Perimeter: A Unique Addition

Among all proposed perimeters, one stands apart: a **governance, change management, and adoption perimeter** specifically designed to facilitate the organizational transformation that Convoke's own expansion creates. This is a meta-perimeter: it helps organizations adopt the other perimeters.

**Potential capabilities:**

- **Change architecture** — Designing adoption strategies using Kotter, ADKAR, and diffusion theory. Mapping organizational readiness. Creating phased rollout plans for new Convoke perimeters.
- **Governance design** — Structuring decision rights using Cynefin and DACI. Defining where agents operate autonomously vs. where human oversight is required. Mapping compliance requirements (EU AI Act, ISO 42001).
- **Adoption facilitation** — Applying behavioral design (Fogg, Eyal, Thaler) to maximize perimeter adoption. Monitoring psychological safety indicators. Designing nudges and habit loops for agent-augmented workflows.

This perimeter would draw on:
- Change management (Kotter, Lewin, ADKAR, Bridges)
- Organizational design (Team Topologies, unFIX, Conway's Law, Sociotechnical Systems)
- Agentic transformation research (Mollick, McKinsey, Anthropic, Brynjolfsson)
- Governance (Cynefin, TOGAF, IEEE 7000, EU AI Act)
- Adoption & diffusion (Rogers, Moore, Fogg, Edmondson)

### 7.4 Priorities and Sequencing

Not all modules need to be built simultaneously. A suggested sequencing based on value, dependency, and the three-axis architecture:

**Wave 0 — Foundations (enable everything else):**
- **Knowledge engineering perimeter** — In brownfield contexts, this activates *first*. Extracts the knowledge that every other perimeter needs. In greenfield, it activates as soon as there's a codebase to mine.

**Wave 1 — Complete the core lifecycle loop:**
- **Delivery perimeter** — Bridges the Gyre-to-production gap
- **Operations perimeter** — Operationalizes Gyre's readiness findings
- **Security perimeter** — Elevates Gyre's security assessment to a proactive discipline

**Wave 2 — Extend lifecycle coverage:**
- **Strategy perimeter** — Grounds discovery in strategic context
- **Growth perimeter** — Closes the post-launch feedback loop
- **Documentation perimeter** — Prevents knowledge loss as perimeters multiply

**Wave 3 — Complete the picture:**
- **Sunset perimeter** — Full lifecycle closure
- **Governance & change perimeter** — Meta-perimeter for organizational adoption
- **Domain-specialized perimeters** (AgentOps, MLOps, DataOps, PlatformOps, etc.) — as demand dictates, informed by the domain mesh reference pattern

### 7.5 Open Questions for Further Exploration

Several theoretical and architectural questions merit deeper investigation:

1. **Agent-to-agent governance:** As modules multiply, how should inter-module handoff contracts be governed? The current HC/GC pattern works within teams — what about *across* teams? The domain mesh's federated governance principle (from Data Mesh) offers a starting point.

2. **Emergent behavior at scale:** With 40+ agents across 15+ modules, what emergent properties should we expect? What guardrails are needed? The AgentVerse (Chen et al., 2023) and Sociotechnical Systems literature offer starting points.

3. **Measuring transformation:** How do we measure the organizational impact of Convoke adoption? DORA metrics cover delivery, but what metrics capture discovery quality, knowledge asset health, adoption success, or governance maturity?

4. **Agent autonomy spectrum:** Cynefin suggests which decisions agents can handle autonomously. But what model governs the *progression* of autonomy over time? How does an organization safely increase agent delegation?

5. **Convoke's own governance:** As Convoke becomes a three-axis platform, how should the project itself be governed? TOGAF's Architecture Development Method, the Team Factory's composition patterns, and the mesh's federated governance offer structures, but the scale may require something new.

6. **Knowledge asset lifecycle:** How do knowledge assets age, decay, and get retired? What metrics indicate knowledge staleness vs. enduring value? Storey's (2026) cognitive debt concept suggests this is increasingly urgent as AI-generated code outpaces human comprehension.

7. **Port interface evolution:** As domain modules mature, how do port interfaces evolve without breaking lifecycle module consumers? Versioning strategies from API design (semver, consumer-driven contracts) may apply.

8. **Mesh observability:** How do we observe the health of the mesh itself — which domain capabilities are most consumed, where are bottlenecks, where is expertise missing? Service mesh observability patterns (Istio, Linkerd) provide technical precedent.

---

*This document serves as the theoretical foundation for Convoke's lifecycle expansion. Each proposed perimeter should be specified using the Team Factory workflow when it matures from exploration to commitment, with agent designs grounded in the references cited here. Knowledge engineering deserves early attention (Wave 0) — without accessible knowledge, every subsequent perimeter operates in the dark. The governance and change management dimension should be developed in parallel — not as an afterthought — since the success of every other perimeter depends on adoption.*
